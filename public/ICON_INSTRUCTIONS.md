# PWA Icons Required

To enable PWA install prompt, you need to create the following icon files:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can:
- Use an online icon generator (e.g., https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- Use design tools (Figma, Photoshop, etc.)
- Use the favicon.ico as a base and resize it

Place both files in the /public directory.

For now, the app will work but the install prompt may not show until icons are added.
