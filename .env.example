# ============================================
# VM Service Configuration
# ============================================
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual values
# This file is a template - actual credentials go in .env.local (which is gitignored)

# Base URL of the vm-service API
# Examples:
#   Development: http://localhost:8080
#   Production: https://api.yourdomain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_VM_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8080

# ============================================
# Client Credentials for Authentication
# ============================================
# These credentials are obtained from your project administrator
# via the Management API endpoint:
#
#   POST /api/v1/projects/:project_id/credentials
#   Headers: X-API-Key: <organization_api_key>
#
# The response includes client_id and client_secret (shown only once!)
# Store these securely - client_secret cannot be retrieved again.

# Client ID - unique identifier for your project
NEXT_PUBLIC_VM_SERVICE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here

# Client Secret - secret key for authentication (keep this secure!)
NEXT_PUBLIC_VM_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here

# ============================================
# Razorpay Configuration
# ============================================
# Razorpay payment gateway configuration for processing payments
# Get these credentials from your Razorpay dashboard: https://dashboard.razorpay.com/

# Razorpay Key ID (public key, safe to expose in frontend)
# Example: rzp_test_1234567890abcd or rzp_live_1234567890abcd
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id_here

# Note: Razorpay Key Secret should NEVER be stored in frontend
# The key secret is used only in backend (API Gateway payment service)

# ============================================
# Notes
# ============================================
# - Project ID is automatically extracted from the access token
#   No need to configure it separately
# - Access tokens are automatically obtained and refreshed
# - Tokens are stored in browser localStorage
# - All API calls use Bearer token authentication
# - Razorpay payments are processed through the payment flow:
#   1. Create order -> 2. Razorpay checkout -> 3. Verify payment -> 4. Dispense
